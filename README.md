Performing Analysis on Kick starter Data to Discover Trends


## Project Overview

### Purpose
Our goal here is to help Louise design her kickstarter campaign to maximize her chance of success. To do so we will leverage the available kickstarter data and identify trends linked with succes and trends to avoid. 

## Analysis and Challenges
We've got a lot raw data to work with. Thankfully we have excell to help us make senese of it all. We'll need 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The chart below shows a notable uptick in the number of successful campaigns launched in May - June. It also shows that fewer kickstarter campaigns launched in December succeed.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The graph of Outcomes vs Goals below shows signicantly higher success rates for more modest goals, esspecially below $5000. There is an apparent uptick between $35000 and $45000, but this graph does a poor job of illustrating how thin the data set is at those ranges.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- From the Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart above we can conclude that the best time to launch a campaign is in May or June. We can further conclude that the worst time to launch is December.

- From comparing Outcomes Based on Goals we can clearly see that lower initial goal are more likely to succeed.

- This dataset gives us a lot to work with, but it does have limitations. One of the clearest limitations is the paucity of campaigns with goals north of $15000. As broken down here, there are some dollar ranges with only a single campaign. Drawing conclusions from this portion of the data is inadvisable. There's also a limit to the picture painted in even the areas where we have ample data. We can see clearly, for example, that for Britih Musicals, failed campaigns set substantially higher fundraising goals than successful campaigns. However, there are many reasons a campaign might fail or succeed, the popularity and track record of the personalities attached, the subject matter of the production, etc. Analysis of such factors may be useful, but is beyond the scope of this data set.

- There are some additional resources that might be useful. A table showing paramerters for the kisckstarters of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Louise liked for example. With only five plays on the list this info could be easily digestable in a table, and would provide Louise with some data for which she has real context, haveing seen the productions resulting from these campaigns.
